\begin{exercise}
	Define all the unnamed maps appearing in the diagrams in the definition of group object, and prove they are indeed isomorphisms when so indicated. (For the projection $1\times G \to G$, what is left to prove is that the composition
	\[
		1\times G \to G \to 1\times G
	\]
	is the identity, as mentioned in the text.)

\begin{exercise}
	$\triangleright$ Show that \emph{groups}, as defined in $\S 1.2$, are `group objects in the category of sets'. [$\S 10.1$]

\begin{exercise}
	Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a group, and suppose $\circ\colon G\times G \to G$ is a group homomorphism (w.r.t. $\cdot$) such that $(G,\circ)$ is \emph{also} a group. Prove that $\circ$ and $\cdot$ coincide. (Hint: First prove that the identity with respect to the two operations must be the same.)

\begin{exercise}
	Prove that every \emph{abelian} group has exactly one structure of group object \emph{in the category} $\srf{Ab}$.

\begin{exercise}
	By the previous exercise, a group object in $\srf{Ab}$ is nothing other than an abelian group. What is a group object in $\srf{Grp}$?

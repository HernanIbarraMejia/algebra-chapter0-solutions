\begin{exercise}
	$\triangleright$ Let $\varphi\colon G \to H$ ve a morphism in a category $\srf{C}$ with products. Explain why there is a unique morphism $(\varphi\times\varphi)\colon G\times G \to H \times H$ compatible in the evident way with the natural projections. 
	
	(This morphism is defined explicitly for $\srf{C} = \srf{Set}$ in $\S 3.1$.) [$\S 3.1, 3.2$]

\begin{exercise}
	Let $\varphi \colon G \to H$, $\psi\colon H \to K$ be morphisms in a category with products, and consider morphisms between the products $G\times G$, $H\times H$, $K\times K$ as in Exercise 3.1. Prove that
	\[
		(\psi\varphi)\times(\psi\varphi) = (\psi\times\psi)(\varphi \times \varphi).
	\]
	(This is part of the commutativity of the diagram displayed in $\S 3.2$.)

\begin{exercise}
	$\triangleright$ Show that if $G,H$ are $\emph{abelian}$ groups, then $G\times H$ satisfies the universal property for coproducts in $\srf{Ab}$ (cf. $\S \RNo{1}.5.5$). [$\S 3.5$, 3.6, $\S \RNo{3}.6.1$]

\begin{exercise}
	Let $G$, $H$ be groups, and assume that $G \cong H \times G$. Can you conclude that $H$ is trivial? (Hint: No. Can you construct a counterexample?)

\begin{exercise}
	$\triangleright$ Consider the product of cyclic groups $C_2$, $C_3$ (cf. $\S 2.3$): $C_2\times C_3$. By Exercise 3.3, this group is a coproduct of $C_2$ and $C_3$ in $\srf{Ab}$. Show that it is \emph{not} a coproduct of $C_2$ and $C_3$ in $\srf{Grp}$, as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item find injective homomorphisms $C_2 \to S_3$, $C_3 \to S_3$;
		\item arguing by contradiction, assume that $C_2\times C_3$ is a coproduct of $C_2$, $C_3$, and deduce that there would be a group homomorphism $C_2\times C_3 \to S_3$, with certain properties;
		\item show that there is no such homomorphism.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
	Show that there is a \emph{surjective} homomorphism $\bZ \ast \bZ \to C_2 \ast C_3$. ($\ast$ denotes coproduct in $\srf{Grp}$; cf. $\S 3.4$.)
	
	One can think of $\bZ$ $\ast$ $\bZ$ as a group with two generators $x, y,$ subject to no relations whatsoever. (We will study a general version of such groups in $\S 5$; see Exercise 5.6.)

\begin{exercise}
	$\triangleright$ Define a group $G$ with two generators $x,y$ subject (only) to the relations $x^2 = e_G, y^3 = e_G$. Prove that $G$ is a coproduct of $C_2$ and $C_3$ \emph{in} $\srf{Grp}$. (The reader will obtain an even more concrete description for $C_2\ast C_3$ in Exercise 9.14; it is called the \emph{modular group}.) [$\S 3.4$, $9.14$]

\begin{exercise}
	Show that \emph{fiber} products and coproducts exist in $\srf{Ab}$. (Cf. Exercise \RNo{1}.5.12. For coproducts, you may have to wait until you know about \emph{quotients}.)
